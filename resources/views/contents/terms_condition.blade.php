Such circumstances include, but are not limited to, civil or political unrest, terrorism, natural disaster, or other force majeure circumstance.

                        It is unlikely that the Company will have to make changes to your tour. However, we may occasionally have to make changes either before or after you have booked. Most changes will be minor, and the Company will advise you of them as soon as possible. The Company reserves the right to alter the itinerary after departure, without paying compensation, if it is in your interest to do so. Furthermore, the Company will not pay compensation if it is forced to cancel or in any way change the tour due to force majeure, such as war, riots, civil strike, industrial dispute, terrorist activity, natural or nuclear disaster, fire, adverse weather conditions, or other material external circumstances beyond the Companyâ€™s control.
